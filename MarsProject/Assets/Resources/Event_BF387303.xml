    <Text><![CDATA[Meg reasons with the bandits, explaining that killing them won't get their payment any quicker, they have learnt their lesson and to just leave with their heads held high.

The bandits look at each other. The middle bandit grows a scowl on his face, spits on the civilian while shouting towards the crowd

"You worthless low-lives ain't gunna get another chance. Make sure we get it next time!"

The bandits walk towards their rover and drive off into the distance.

We got a few thank yous from the crowd, a single man approaches and tosses us a bag, bows his head and goes back to work, then we continued onwards with our journey.
