    <Text><![CDATA[We entered the dank cave cautiously, with our weapons at the ready. One of us used a flashlight to illuminate the narrow path. Following the trail of blood, we eventually came upon a large expansive room with two corpses sat against a wall. One had a large wound in her abdomen, which had ripped open her suit. The other had a rifle in her hands, aiming towards the entrance. 

They couldnâ€™t have been dead for longer than a week. We looted what supplies that they had on them. We left the cave, got back in the rover and drove off into the distance.]]></Text>
