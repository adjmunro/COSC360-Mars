    <Text><![CDATA[After returning the message, coordinates appeared on our map.

A days trip later, we reached a fortified scrap yard in the dead of night. Turning our rovers lights out, we made a stealthy approach. 

One crew member scouted the small compound, and noted that there were 6 bandits scattered around, one of which having a blade protruding out of an amputated left arm. 

This was the tell tale sign of the bandit called Razor whom the bounty was placed upon. He sat on a chair, whistling and sharpening his blade.
