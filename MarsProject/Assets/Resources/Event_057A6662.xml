    <Text><![CDATA[Reed walks through the front gate of the compound and announces his presence to all the bandits. He claims that his raiding party was killed, and is looking for a new gang to join. Razor bolts up, and declares
<i>"Any new initiates need to pay a tribute. What have you got?"</i>
Reed enthusiastically claims that he has 8 kegs of alcohol in his rover, and he needs help carrying it all. Razor grins and beckons all the bandits to come join.
All the bandits group up and follow Reed around a corner, where they are met by a barrage of gunfire from our crew. They returned fire, but no cover led to them all being eviscerated in seconds. 

After handing it in Razors arm blade to a local MSS station, we received our Bounty Reward and continued onwards with our journey.]]></Text>
