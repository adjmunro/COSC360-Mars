    <Text><![CDATA[We all pile out of our rover, and grab our tools and head on over. After a few diagnostic tests, it looks like they drove over a large rock which had punctured the fuel tank underneath their rover.

After a days worth of labour and spare parts, their rover eventually sputters to life. The other survivors hug each other in tears. They claim that we saved their life, and gave us half of their rations as a reward. We took our earnings, and returned back to our rover.]]></Text>
