    <Text><![CDATA[Early in the morning, a large bang was heard inside the rover, and a warning light goes off on the dashboard. The temperature in the rover lowered, as it appears our onboard heating system has broken. We have the repair parts for it, but it would take a full day to fix.

The temperature outside measures at -45C currently, and with our temperature dropping, we were running out of time.
