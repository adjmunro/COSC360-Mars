    <Text><![CDATA[As Reed pops his head out of the rover door and locks eyes with the large man. The large mans face distorts with murderous intent, pulls out his weapon and takes a shot at Reed. This in turns makes the checkpoints patrols begin firing at the rover.
Our tires screeched against the dirt as we booked it out of there, dodging as much fire as possible. 

After we escaped, we had to spend an extra day searching for a new route. We were able to deduce that maybe Reed double-crossed some people in his bandit days.
