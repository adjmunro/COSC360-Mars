    <Text><![CDATA[Amidst the frenzy, someone shouts to grab all the oxygen tanks and fuel canisters we can carry.

We hastily grabbed what we could and booked it out of the rover towards ours, just as a loud droning noise echoes from the crashed rover, as it begins to fold and compress in on itself continuously, until the rover is just a small ball of crushed jagged metal laying on the ground.

We wondered what information would be so valuable to implement such a desperate function on a rover.
Packing our newfound supplies into our storage, we headed back off into our route.
