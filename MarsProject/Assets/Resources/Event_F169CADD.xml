    <Text><![CDATA[Kate slams her foot on the accelerator straight into the middle of the hounders.

Before the beasts can even react, the rover is slicing through any gaps in the mass, and running over any hounders that happen to be in the way.

As Kate drives around a particularly large hounder, she failed to spot a large boulder behind him, and slams straight into it. The rover still runs fine, but the whiplash injures everyone in the vehicle.

Soon enough, Kate is able to maneuver the rover out of the mass, and drives off while the hounders give up the chase.]]></Text>
