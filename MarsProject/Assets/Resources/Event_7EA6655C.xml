    <Text><![CDATA[Two bandits jump out of their rover and begin shooting at us. After a few seconds, we were able to get behind our rover for cover. 

After both sides exchanging gunfire, we eventually came out on top.

We quickly looted their rover for any fuel, hoping to get out of here before any of their friends turn up.]]></Text>
