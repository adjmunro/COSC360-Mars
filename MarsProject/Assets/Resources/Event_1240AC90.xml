    <Text><![CDATA[After scaling a sand dune, we spotted an overturned rover at its base. It was clearly battle worn, bearing scorch marks and bullet dents.
As we approached it cautiously, our rover's comms fired up.
 
"Please, no more! We surrender, just take whatever we have and don't hurt us!"

Two oxygen tanks and a large tin of fuel is thrown from behind the overturned rover towards us.
