    <Text><![CDATA[One of our crewmembers attempts to reason with the bandits, promising them that the settlement will pay the oxygen price next time. This is met by nodding in the crowd.

The bandits look to each other, and the middle one grows a scowl in his face, and spits on the civilian further pushing the gun barrel into his back.

<i>"You scum ain't gunna get another chance! Don't make that mistake again!"</i>

The bandits walk away into their rover, and drive off into the distance. The crowd breaths a collective sigh of relief, one man walks over gives us this thanks hands us a bag and turns back to work.
