    <Text><![CDATA[One of our crewmembers attempts to reason with the bandits, promising them that the settlement will pay the oxygen price next time. This is met by nodding in the crowd.

The middle bandit smiles and pushes the gun barrel further into the civilians back.

<i>"None of you will learn that way then though, would'ya? Business is business."</i>

The bandit fires, and the civilians body slumps to the ground. The bandits turn and leave to their rover, and drive off. 

The crowd hangs their heads, and returns back to work.
