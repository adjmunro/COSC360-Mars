    <Text><![CDATA[After switching off any noise or light making equipment, we quitely drove around the mass.

A screeching howl bellows from a single hounder which spotted us. Suddenly, the whole mass turns towards us, flying into a frenzy and charges.

In an effort to escape the oncoming hoard, we gave the rover full speed, but accidentally crashed into a large rock, whiplashing everyone in the rover.

We quickly pulled away, and managed to escape the mass of hounders, a bit worse for wear.]]></Text>
