    <Text><![CDATA[As we drove over the top of a hill, we saw an overturned rover in the distance. As we approached it, two large <b>hounders</b> appeared from behind the rover. 

Hounders are creatures that escaped from a laboratory aiming to create life that could survive Mars’ environment. They’re incredibly hostile creatures resembling black, bear-sized, naked mole rats, and are now a plague for anyone working outside unprotected.

Upon hearing the sound of our rover, the two hounders screeched, and charged at us.
