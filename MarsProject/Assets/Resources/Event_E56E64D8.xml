    <Text><![CDATA[Thank you. Calibration 50% complete.

Please move to the <b><Bio></b> screen, and click any of the survivor portraits to view their information.

This will display their biography and traits. Traits are qualities that define that survivor, and will change how you wish to proceed in any events.
In the event that a survivor's HP reaches 0, they have died and the crew does not have access to their traits anymore. 

To finish calibration, please select the <CALIBRATE> button one more time, and <COMMIT>.
