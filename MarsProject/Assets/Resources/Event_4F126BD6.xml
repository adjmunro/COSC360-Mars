    <Text><![CDATA[Even if we get out of this position, we canâ€™t outrun 3 rovers. We decided to take the preemptive strike.

After accelerating the rover straight into the side of a bandit rover, we rolled it on its side. The other two bandit rovers began firing at us, and we returned fire. After a long firefight with a lot of injuries on our side, we eventually came out on top. We looted the contents of the other 3 rovers, and quickly got out of there incase any other showed up.]]></Text>
