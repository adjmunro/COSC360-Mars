    <Text><![CDATA[In an effort to sneak attack them, we tossed a bag of alcohol out the door towards their rover. Four Bandits exited the vehicle to collect the bag. Kate accelerated the rover towards them, running one of them over.

Shocked, the 3 other bandits open fire on our rover. We all returned fire from the doorway, until all 3 bandits lay dead on the ground. We collected our alcohol, looted the contents of their rover and moved onward with our journey.
